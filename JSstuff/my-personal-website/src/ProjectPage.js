      <p>Published on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00759v1", href="_blank">arXiv</a> , providing a valuable learning experience in the research process, including literature review, experimentation, and paper writing.
      The process of writing the paper deepened my understanding of modern computer vision techniques such as efficient bottlenecks, vision transformers, and other advanced architectures.
      Additionally, I was able to learn how to write sections of a research paper, including the abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion.
      For citations, I utilized Zotero to manage references and citations, and Microsoft Word and LaTeX for writing the paper.</p>
